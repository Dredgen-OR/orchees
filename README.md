# Veera

An entirely new and rewritten Granblue companion based on the Ancheera concept.
Keep track of supplies, plan weapon crafts, analyze battle & GW data, and more.

# Development

* Still a WIP so parts don't work, features are missing. Help is appreciated.
  * It will eventually be a normal, updatable extension. Probably. Maybe.
* Check Issues page for things to work on, file bug reports, etc.
* Feature requests are alright but they'll take a while as core functionality is the current priority.
* ~~Also I'm lazy so updates are slow.~~

# Installation & Usage

1. Download or clone the repo into a folder.
   * Cloning allows easy updating during dev phase.
2. In your Chrome extensions page, click "Load unpacked extension..." and point to the repo folder.
   * Make sure developer mode is enabled if you don't see the button.
   * To recompile after changes, hit the reload button beneath the extension.
1. Load granblue and hit F12 to bring up the Chrome devtools.
2. Navigate to the Veera tab.
